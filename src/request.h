 * A request has 8 flow states availables:
 * - FSError                     => An error occur (view errcode for more info)
 * - FSCreated                   => The request is created
 * - FSConnecting                => The request has a connecting
 *                                    socket to request_host
 * - FSConnected                 => The request has a connection
 * - FSSending                   => The request is sent
 * - FSWaitingResponse           => Waiting request response
 * - FSResponseReceived          => Request response was received
 * - FSFinished                  => Request is terminated
 *
 * A request with FSError is along of errcode variable which detail
 * the error (view REQ_ERR_* macro def).
